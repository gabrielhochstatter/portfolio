          <h5><em>Sep 2018 - Present</em></h5>
          <p className='cv-text'>
            Worked on a client-side team based at Vodafone UKâ€™s London office. 
            My team was responsible for improving conversion rates on their e-commerce site using data collected from analytics. 
            I worked closely not only with other developers but also with analytics specialists and UX designers to optimize customer journeys.

            When it came to tech I wrote most of my code in ES6/7 JavaScript, using React for our framework and Jest and Enzyme for testing.
          </p>

            I also had a hand in making sure releases to production went smoothly by working with the DevOps teams to streamline the CI/CD processes used.
